A Chemosynthetic World: Space Apps Challenge

This is a program that creates a simulation with a potential chemosynthetic environment. It is not very powerful; doesn't make anything too big. But it cna give us a better understanding of what chemosynthesis even is in the first place, and secondly, it can help us understand what types of animals may live in a world like this. This is just a demo. If we had some more time, our goal was to create an open-world game where people would be able to BE a chemosynthetic animal and move around to complete quests and gain a deep understanding of this field, while still having fun!
