A Chemosynthetic World: Space Apps Challenge

This is a program that creates a simulation with a potential chemosynthetic environment. It is not very powerful; doesn't make anything too big. But it cna give us a better understanding of what chemosynthesis even is in the first place, and secondly, it can help us understand what types of animals may live in a world like this. This is just a demo. If we had some more time, our goal was to create an open-world game where people would be able to BE a chemosynthetic animal and move around to complete quests and gain a deep understanding of this field, while still having fun!

We have used HTML, Javascript, and CSS to create this demo code. We also used three.js to create 3D models and animations.
